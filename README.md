# A badge for the little one

For a while I was looking to build a badge using a Raspberry Pi Zero and a Waveshare e-INK display. Everything I tried, it was just to bulky and heavy. Then the awesome people at Pimoroni came out with the badger2040 platform. Exactly what I needed!

Well almost, I added a couple of things to make it practical for my purposes. The badge is now on Hardware Platform v3 and has the following functions:

- Badge : name, photo and my contact number
- List : a simple listing of the items my kid takes to school
- Image : a couple of photos of us together
- Timer : an activity countdown timer with 6 selectable activities and preset times
- Temp : displays the current temperature, humidity, pressure and shows descriptions on the weather
- Elevation : measure height in meters and floors
